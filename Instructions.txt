First of all, make sure to click install python.bat this will take you to python.org/downloads 
Click download latest 
Run the .exe and MAKE SURE TO CLICK ADD PYTHON TO THE PATH

After doing that click on install.bat this will install all dependencies you need in order to execute the code 
When that is done click on start.bat this will start the script and it should pop up a window asking you to enter the amount of codes you want generated.
Insert the amount you want and then it will ask you if you would like to use a webhook for discord if you insert one once it finds a code it is gonna send the code to that channel. If you chose to skip the webhook part once a valid code is found the script will stop it self.
This is a nitro generator and checker meaning it checks every code so you don't have to do much.
